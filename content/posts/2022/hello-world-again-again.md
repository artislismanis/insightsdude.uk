Coming back to the idea of blogging is beginning to feel like a scene out of Groundhog Day. I've lost count of my false starts. I keep scribbling down ideas for blog posts and 'today I learned' experiences in my bullet journal, but never really get beyond the good intentions stage when it actually comes to writing it all up. Whether it is urgent work stuff or personal commitments, life just seems to get in the way. :unamused:

At a recent all hands meeting at work I heard a powerful idea that really resonated and has stuck with me.

> **If you’re doing a great job, then are you documenting it, and are you communicating it; if not, how do you expect anyone to know?**

Indeed! This was in the context of Technology teams more proactively highlighting the business outcomes they support and enable, but really applies to pretty much everything. This reminded me of a post on a LinkedIn I read a year or two ago where a recruiter was reflecting on data professionals expecting to be recognised as thought leaders but not putting in any work to share their thoughts :thought_balloon:, let alone lead.  

With 2022 coming to an end, it is a good opportunity for me to reflect on what kind of data professional I want to be going forward and maybe even get a head start on any 2023 New Year's resolutions. :clipboard: While I'm a part of different data communities through meetups and conferences I attend, there is probably something to be said about a more proactive sharing of my experiences, insights and thoughts with wider audiences. Now I just need to decide if I want to be as data driven as I tell my stakeholders to be and commit to a quantitative metric to measure my progress. :bar_chart:

With reference to [Hello World! Again!]({{< ref "/posts/2021/hello-world-again.md" >}} "Hello World! Again!"), what’s different this time? A good few days spent tinkering with servers and hosting… :grin:
