It is probably something like ~~57th~~ 63rd time I write my 'first' blog entry. Over the years I have had so many false starts that I've lost the count. It is usually a good few days spent tinkering with servers and hosting, checking out blogging software, switching on SEO plugins, writing a few paragraphs of content, not being able to decide what to put in 'About Me' page and then just giving up. I think it was only once that I managed to write a couple of posts and had an idea for a few more. What's different this time? A good few days spent tinkering with servers and hosting... :laughing:
